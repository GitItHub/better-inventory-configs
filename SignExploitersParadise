//Signs penetrate ANY permission wall that your server might have. That allows for the numerous exploit signs I list here.
//Best use on FreeOP servers. Currently does not work on TF, as they disabled ALL signs.

//like, play.totalfreedom.me


//Euclid
//Doom sign. Use on servers that have doom! TotalFreedom is an example. Lure into clicking by the fact it has 'cake' on the sign.

//Kill-All sign. Kills all players. Could be used for abuse. NOTE: replace <your name here> with your player name or the player's name you want to trick into clicking the sign as the fact you executed it makes for a permban.

//Smite-All sign. Could be used when you are angry at the server. NOTE: Replace 'YourNameHere' with your player name or the player's name you want to trick into clicking the sign. Because if you click it, you can be permbanned.
